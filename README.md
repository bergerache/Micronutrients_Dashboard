# Micronutrients_Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard promoting nutritional health through the exploration of micronutrients

Micronutrient deficiencies pose a significant global health challenge, affecting over 40% of the adult population worldwide. Despite the critical role of vitamins and minerals in human health, public awareness and understanding of micronutrients remain limited. This dissertation presents the development of an interactive, web-based dashboard designed to bridge the gap between complex nutritional science and practical dietary choices.
The project utilised data from the USDA's 2019-2020 Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies and the National Institute of Health's Health Professional Fact Sheets to create a comprehensive micronutrient visualisation tool. Using Tableau, the dashboard was designed to present information on 20 key micronutrients, including their Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), physiological functions, deficiency symptoms, and food sources.
The resulting dashboard offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows users to explore micronutrient data through interactive bar charts, gender-specific filters, and food item comparisons. It provides a unique combination of quantitative nutritional data with qualitative health information, making it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, educators, policymakers, and health-conscious individuals.
This study demonstrates the potential of data visualisation in making complex nutritional information accessible and actionable. The dashboard not only serves as an educational tool but also has implications for public health policy and personal nutrition management. While acknowledging limitations such as potential cultural bias in food selection, this project contributes to the broader goal of improving public health through enhanced micronutrient awareness and informed dietary choices.
