# 🩺 Micronutrients Health Analytics Dashboard
**Public Health Data Visualization | MSc Data Science and Analytics Dissertation (Distinction)**

## 🎯 Project Overview
Interactive dashboard making USDA nutritional data accessible through visualisation, supporting evidence-based dietary decisions and public health research.

## 🔬 Research Impact
Addresses the critical challenge that **micronutrient deficiencies affect over 40% of adults worldwide**, yet public understanding remains limited. This project bridges complex nutritional science with practical dietary guidance.

## 📊 Data Source & Methodology
Built on the **USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2019-2020 (FNDDS)**, an application database designed to convert food and beverage portions reported in What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey into gram amounts and to determine their nutrient values.

**Dataset Specifications:**
- **5,624 food items** with complete nutritional profiles
- **20 key micronutrients** with gender-specific RDA values
- **Official USDA data** ensuring accuracy and reliability
- **Comprehensive coverage** of common dietary foods across demographics

*See [documentation](./docs/) for complete USDA methodology and data specifications.*

## 📊 Technical Implementation
- **Data Source:** USDA FNDDS 2019-2020 (5,624 food items)
- **Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing and recommended daily allowance (RDA) calculations
- **Visualization:** Interactive Tableau dashboard
- **Scope:** 20 key micronutrients with gender-specific RDA comparisons

## 💊 Key Features
- **Interactive Bar Charts** - Compare nutrient values across foods
- **Gender-Specific Filters** - Male/Female RDA recommendations  
- **Food Item Comparisons** - Search and compare nutritional profiles
- **Health Information** - Micronutrient main function, deficiency symptoms and rich food sources
- **Educational Tool** - For healthcare professionals and health-conscious individuals
